# How to play: Escape from Collapse
If this is the first time you play, you must be registered to start. When you register the program will let you log in. However, if you run the program again, you must log in first.

When you select the option to play (option number 3), you must choose how many players you want to play with (you can play with up to 4 players). In case you are alone and want to play against the artificial intelligence, you must enter that you only want to play with one player.

The objective is to reach the other side of the map. That is, to the other end.

For example, if we are player 1, we must reach the row where player 2 is to win. However, if we are player 2, we must reach the row where player 1 is located:

Each turn a locker collapses, and you cannot access that one. Nor can you access to where there is a player, nor outside the board (obviously).

Remember that you can give up at any time. However, it is not recommended since you can collapse boxes favorably in the last moves, and thus have a chance to win.
